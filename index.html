Leap Motion<br>
The Leap Motion view still currently just shows double windows for the 2 eyes. We are going to make a glfw window with anaglyph soon, but it was not our top priority.<br>

<h2>Post 1: Final Project Introduction</h2> 06/05/2017
<h3>Name of project:</h3> Basil Party

<h3>Team members:</h3>
               Edward Wang
               Rachel Lee

<h3>Description:</h3>
This game is either going to be 1) a boxing game or 2) a head-to-head battle to collect the most bees to feed them to
Basil even though Basil prefers to eat steak.

<h3>Screenshot:</h3>
Below is a screenshot of our current progress. The first screen is the Oculus mirror of Basil in Boston.
The second image is our WIP of the anaglyph screen. We were not yet able to resolve the bug regarding rendering
to the single quad for anaglyph (similar to project 3).
